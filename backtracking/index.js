// BackTracking

//parent is Recursion
//Number of choices will be large (ex: string possible premutation the larger the string the more choices it will have)
//possible combinations will be asked
//Backtracking = Controlled Recursion + pass by reference
//Contraints- input size will be very small like 10

//controlled recusion means
//ex Your house is in SW at you are at middle you can take 4 steps
//to raech home now you know that only taking steps to south or west is
//only choices tecnhnically else you wont reach home
// so when ever we go east or north we write some base case if condn
//so that we dont check that this is an example of controlled recursion

//pass by referece means your actual value also change while pass an in function

//backtracking function return type is usually void but not necessary
